    <p>In my spare time I have been teaching myself web development, learning Ruby, RoR, HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript and jQuery. I completed the Web Application Developer short-course at Coder Factory
      in February but have otherwise been following along with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a>.
    </p>

    <p>I have finished a couple of Ruby command line games and am working on a few Rails apps.
      Please take a look at my Resume and Github account.
